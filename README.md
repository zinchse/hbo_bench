**`TL;DR`** This is a dataset that allows us to run tens of thousands of experiments for query optimisation via using so-called hints in a *few minutes* on a laptop. 
The idea is that almost all the required calculations have been cached, and instead of execution we actually do simple look-up.

**Contribution:** were collected cached query execution results with different sets of hints, and implemented `torch`-like `Dataset` and `DataLoader`, vectorisation procedure 
for query execution plans and local search procedure for efficient exploration of parameter space.
 
# üí° Idea behind this benchmark

**H**int-**B**ased query **O**ptimisation (HBO) is an approach to optimising the query execution time that allows accelerating the workload execution without changing a single line of DBMS kernel code.
This is achieved by selecting the planner hyperparameters (*hints*) influencing the construction of the query execution plan. Despite the fact that this approach
can speed up query execution many times over (*check it!*), it is associated with a fundamental complexity - the search space **is exponential**, and the cost of exploring a "point" in it **depends on its execution time**.


# üßê Why is it useful? 

As a simple observation demonstrating the potential usefulness of this project, - it has allowed us to reduce the search space from exponential to **linear** with virtually no loss in performance. 

# üì¶ Setup 

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -v venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install -y p7zip-full
7za x data/raw/raw_data.7z -odata/raw
python3 process_raw_data.py
pytest || [ $? -eq 5 ]
```

# üöÄ How To 

The key object that allows emulation of DBMS operation is `Oracle` (terminology is taken from maths, no connection with @Oracle). The simplest examples of using its functionality are presented in `example.ipynb`

  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
  We used the following list of hints, which are controlled by the corresponding global user configuration parameters (`GUC`s):
  
  ```python
  HINTS: "List[Hint]" = [
      "Nested Loop",
      "Merge",
      "Hash",
      "Bitmap",
      "Index Only Scan",
      "Index Scan",
      "Seq Scan",
  ]

  GUCS: "List[GUC]" = [
      "nestloop",
      "mergejoin",
      "hashjoin",
      "bitmapscan",
      "indexonlyscan",
      "indexscan",
      "seqscan",
  ]
  ```

  To enumerate all combinations of such hints, we simply use bit masks corresponding to the above order (the high bit is responsible for "Nested Loop", the low bit for "Seq Scan").
